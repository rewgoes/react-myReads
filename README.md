# MyReads
A book organizer that lets the user search for books and add in one of the bookshelfs: currently reading, want to read or read. This project is part of the Udacity's React Nanodegree.

## Running the App
* Clone or download this repo.

* Access `localhost:3000` and enjoy the App. 

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
